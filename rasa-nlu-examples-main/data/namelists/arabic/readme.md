The namelists here are from;

- [Wikipedia Arabic Name List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Arabic_given_names).
The name list was parsed and put in a long list. We've seperated each part of the given name
such that they may also be individually identified. It's an assumption on our side that this
is appropriate, if this isn't the case we'll gladly hear it. If there's a better datasource
we'll also gladly hear it.
- The Moroccan namelist was gathered from three moroccan websites, namely : [Morocco Guide](https://www.morocco-guide.com/travel-tips/moroccan-names/), [Prenom Marocain](https://www.morocco-guide.com/travel-tips/moroccan-names/) and [Guide Maroc](http://www.guide-maroc.net/prenoms-marocains-maroc.html). The names in the file are listed alphabetically.
