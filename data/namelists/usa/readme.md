It's important to source the namelists in this repo.

The USA name data was retreived from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datagov/usa-names).
It contains 18402 names from 1910-2013 across the US. It should also contain many interational
names but less frequent names are cut off. The names are sorted on popularity.
